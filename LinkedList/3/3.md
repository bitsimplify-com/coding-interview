# Split Linked List in Parts
# Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts".The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1. This may lead to some parts being null.

### Input: it contains two lines,first line contains integer k, and second line contains head of the linked list 
### Output: return k lines, each line containing a part of the linked list as given in the condition.The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.
