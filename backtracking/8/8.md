# Subsets
# Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.
# Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
# The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
# Also, the subsets should be sorted in ascending ( lexicographic ) order.
# The given list is not necessarily sorted.

# Example :
# Input: arr = [1 2 3]
# Output: [[],[1],[1, 2],[1, 2, 3],[1, 3],[2],[2, 3],[3]]
### Input: 2 lines;First line containing length of arr and second line containing arr
### Output: print all the possible combinations in the order given in the question
