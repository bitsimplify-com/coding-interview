# Permutation Sequence
# The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
# By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

# "123"
# "132"
# "213"
# "231"
# "312"
# "321"
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

### Input: first and only line contains 2 integers n and k in the same order.
### Output: print a single line, the kth permutation as a string.
