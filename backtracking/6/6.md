# Unique Paths
# On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:
# 1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
# 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
# 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
# -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
# Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

# Example :
# Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
# Output: 2
### Input:First line contains number of rows(n) and number of columns(m).Each of the next n lines contains m integers.
### Output: print a single integer which is the number of unique paths according to given condition.
