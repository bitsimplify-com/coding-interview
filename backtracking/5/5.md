# Beautiful Arrangement
# Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:
# The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
# i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
# Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

# Example :
# Input: 2
# Output: 2
### Input: single line containing n
### Output: print a single integer which is the total number of arrangements possible for n
