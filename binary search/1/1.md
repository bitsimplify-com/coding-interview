# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array 
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
# (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# Find the minimum element.
# The array may contain duplicates.

### Input: contains 2 lines,first line contains the length of the array;second line contains the rotated sorted array 
### Output: print a single integer which is the minimum value of the array in O(LogN) time
