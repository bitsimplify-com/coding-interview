## Possible Questions to ask:


## Explanation:
The problem was posed with three colours, here `0′, `1′ and `2′. The array is divided into four sections:

    a[1..Lo-1] zeroes (red)
    a[Lo..Mid-1] ones (white)
    a[Mid..Hi] unknown
    a[Hi+1..N] twos (blue)

The unknown region is shrunk while maintaining these conditions

        Lo := 1; Mid := 1; Hi := N;
        while Mid <= Hi do
            Invariant: a[1..Lo-1]=0 and a[Lo..Mid-1]=1 and a[Hi+1..N]=2; a[Mid..Hi] are unknown.
            case a[Mid] in
                0: swap a[Lo] and a[Mid]; Lo++; Mid++
                1: Mid++
                2: swap a[Mid] and a[Hi]; Hi–
