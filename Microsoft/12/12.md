## Explanation:
Recursive method to find height of Binary Tree is discussed here. How to find height without recursion? We can use level order traversal to find height without recursion. The idea is to traverse level by level. Whenever move down to a level, increment height by 1 (height is initialized as 0). Count number of nodes at each level, stop traversing when the count of nodes at the next level is 0
