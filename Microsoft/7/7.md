## Explanation:
Whenever we encounter any file’s name, we simply push it into the stack. when we come across ” . ” we do nothing. When we find “..” in our path, we simply pop the topmost element as we have to jump back to parent’s directory.
When we see multiple “////” we just ignore them as they are equivalent to one single “/”. After iterating through the whole string the elements remaining in the stack is our simplified absolute path. We have to create another stack to reverse the elements stored inside the original stack and then store the result inside a string.
