## Explanation:
The idea is to traverse the linked list following the below approach:

If the list is empty or contains less than 2 elements, return false.
Otherwise check if the current node is the second last node of the linked list or not. That is, if (current_node->next-next == NULL ) then the current node is the second last node.
If the current node is the second last node, print the node otherwise move to the next node.
Repeat the above two steps until the second last node is reached.
