# Reverse a linked list

### Input:
@Input@
### Output:
@Output@


## Possible Questions to ask:
can we do the same using recursively
can we do it using iteratively

## Explanation:

      1)  Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
      2) Iterate trough the linked list. In loop, do following.
        // Before changing next of current,
        // store next node
        next = curr->next

        // Now change next of current
        // This is where actual reversing happens
        curr->next = prev

        // Move prev and curr one step forward
        prev = curr
        curr = next
