# Vertical Order Traversal
# Given the root of a binary tree print the vertical order traversal of the tree.If two nodes have the same vertical level from left to right,print the one that comes first in level order traversal.If level is also same,print the one that comes first in preorder traversal.
# In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)
# Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

# Example :

# Input: root = 1 2 3 -1 -1 4
# Output: [[2],[1,4],[3]]
### Input: single line containing root of the binary tree
### Output: print multiple lines,ith line containing all the nodes of ith vertical level.
