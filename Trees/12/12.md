# Flatten Tree to linked list
# Given the root of a binary tree ,flatten it to a singly linked list as shown
# For example, given the following tree:
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
# The flattened tree should look like:

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6

# Input: root = [1 2 3 -1 -1 4]
# Output: [1 -1 2 -1 3 -1 4]
### Input: single line containing root of the binary tree
### Output: print two lines,first line containing the postorder traversal and second line containing the preorder traversal.
