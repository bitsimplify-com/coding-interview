# Path in Zig Zag Tree
# In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.
# In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.
# Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.

# Example :
# Input: label = 14
# Output: [1,3,4,14]
### Input: single line containing the label
### Output: single line containing the entire path from root to label, seperated by spaces
