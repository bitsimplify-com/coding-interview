# The root is the maximum number in the array.
# The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
# The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.
# Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

### Input: 2 lines,first line contains length of array,second line contains the array
### Output: 2 lines; print preorder of the tree in 1st line and inorder of the tree in the 2nd line.
