Computers, unlike humans, cannot understand the natural language. The difficult task in Natural Language Processing for computers is understanding the correct meaning of the sentence ie its semantic, correct Name Entity Recognization (NER) and understanding the proper parts of the speech like nouns, pronouns, adjectives, etc. What we generally do to make machines understand the NLP is feeding enough data to train the model so that it can identify all of the above categories and if in case it encounters a new word, it tries to make the nearest guess based on its previous experience.
