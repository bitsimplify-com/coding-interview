# Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

# Given a square grid of integers arr, a falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of arr, such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.
# Return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.
# (i.e. from an elemtent i,j where i the row and j is the column, you can choose any of valid i+1,k where k!=j).
# Example :
# Input: arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: 13
### Input: two lines;first line contains the number of rows and columns in the array,second line contains the vector in a single line.
### Output: print a single integer as per the given condition
