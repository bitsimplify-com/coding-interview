# Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

# A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.
# (i.e. from an elemtent i,j where i the row and j is the column, you can choose any of valid (i+1,j-1),(i+1,j),(i+1,j+1).)
# Example :
# Input: arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: 12
### Input: two lines;first line contains the number of rows and columns in the array,second line contains the vector in a single line.
### Output: print a single integer as per the given condition
