# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
# Example
# Input: array = [100 4 200 1 3 2]
# Output: 4
### Input: two lines;first line contains the length of the vector and second line contains elements of the vector
### Output: print a single integer which is the length of the longest consecutive elements.
