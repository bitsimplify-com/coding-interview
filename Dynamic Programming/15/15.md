# Longest Arithmetic Progression
# Find longest Arithmetic Progression in an integer array A of size N, and return its length.
# More formally, find longest sequence of indices, 0 < i1 < i2 < … < ik < ArraySize(0-indexed) such that sequence A[i1], A[i2], …, A[ik] is an Arithmetic Progression.
# Arithmetic Progression is a sequence in which all the differences between consecutive pairs are the same, i.e sequence B[0], B[1], B[2], …, B[m - 1] of length m is an Arithmetic Progression if and only if B[1] - B[0] == B[2] - B[1] == B[3] - B[2] == … == B[m - 1] - B[m - 2]
# The common difference can be positive, negative or 0.
# Example :
# Input: Arr=[3,6,7,9]
# Output: 3
### Input: single line containing the the length of the array followed by the array itself
### Output: single integer which is the length of the longest subsequence in the array which is an arithmetic progression in the array.
