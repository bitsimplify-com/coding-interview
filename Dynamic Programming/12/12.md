# Dungeon Game
# The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
# The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
# Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
# In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
# Example :
# input:
-2 (K)	-3	3
-5	-10	1
10	30	-5 (P)
# Output: 7
### Input: single line containing the dungeon vector
### Output: single line containing the minimum health required to save the princess
