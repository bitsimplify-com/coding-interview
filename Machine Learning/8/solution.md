**Logistic Regression is a classification model, generally used to predict binary outcomes. The output of Logistic Regression is either 0 or 1. To convert it into binary classes, a threshold value is assigned. Numbers lower than the threshold value are converted into 0 while numbers higher than the threshold value are converted to 1. This can be better understood with the help of an example.
Suppose you have the result of Logistic Regression as 0.3,0.7,0.66 and 0.2. The threshold value you have decided is 0.6. So 0.3 and 0.2 will be converted to class 0 while 0.66 and 0.7 will be converted to class 1.**
