Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the most fundamental algorithms used in classification problems. It is based on the concept of Bayesian Probability. The Bayesian or Conditional Probability of an event is defined as the probability of happening of an event, let us call ‘A’, given that another event ‘B’ has already occurred. Therefore it can be defined as

**P(A/B)=P(AꓵB)/P(B) or [P(B/A) x P(A)]/P(B)**

The problem with Naïve Bayes Algorithm is that it assumes the presence or absence of a particular feature is completely unrelated to the presence or absence of another feature. That is it assumes that all the given features are independent of each other, which normally is not the case with the real-world datasets. Hence, the word ‘naïve’ is coined.
