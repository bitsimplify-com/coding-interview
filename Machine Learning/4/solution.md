A confusion matrix is generally used when performing classification using Machine Learning Algorithms. It is used to judge the accuracy of the model. An example of a confusion matrix is given below.

When the actual and predicted results overlap, this means the algorithm has correctly predicted the situation. If this is not the case, the algorithm has wrongly classified the situation. This means if you move towards the leading diagonal, you will get the number of cases that are correctly classified.

In this case, the number of correctly classified cases are: 50+100=150.

Therefore, the accuracy of the algorithm is: 150/(50+5+10+100)=90% approx.
