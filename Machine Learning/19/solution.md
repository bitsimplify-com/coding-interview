SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is generally used in classification problems. From the name is quite clear that it creates a support line/pane which distinguishes the classes specified in the problem. It works in a way like we need to first plot the points in a plane ( points here refers to the features of the given dataset). These points are known as support vectors. The algorithm then automatically determines the line or the plane which will accurately classify the given points keeping in mind that the points nearest to the distinguishable line/plane lie farthest apart from them. This will be quite clear with the help of the image given below

The line in the center will be the best fit because of the condition stated above ie, the nearest points to the given plane should lie farthest apart from them.
