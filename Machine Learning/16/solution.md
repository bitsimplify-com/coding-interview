Apriori Algorithm works on the principle of Association Rule Mining. It is a technique used to identify hidden relations among different sets of objects. This can be understood with the help of the following example.

Suppose you are shopping in a supermarket and you want to purchase bread, butter, milk, and perfume. Now you will generally observe that bread, butter and milk will nearly be kept at the same place while the position of the perfume will be different from these 3. This is a typical use case of the Apriori Algorithm as it has identified the relationship between the 3 essentials- milk, bread, and butter while differentiating the 4th  one- the perfume. Mathematically, we will be discussing it in the later questions.
