The above situation indicates that the model is overfitting. A training error of 0.00 means the model has learned the data set instead of finding the correlation between the different features. As we get the validation error of 34.23, this supports our argument that the model is overfitted. This is quite a common problem in Radom Forest. The best way to solve this problem is to prune the number of trees in the used model.
