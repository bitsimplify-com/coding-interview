# Course Schedule
# There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.
# Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

# Example :
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: 1
### Input: Two lines. First Line contains two integers denoting number of courses(n) and the length of prerequisites array(k).Second line contains the prerequisite array.Prerequisites array is 2-D with size k and size of each row is 2.
