# Check if array has duplicate in O(1) space complexity. The array has elements between 0 n-1 and the ,size of the array is n. Follow up: Print the duplicate elements.

### Input: @Input@
### Output: @Output@

## Possible Questions to ask:
- Should the output be printed in sorted order?
- Can we modify the original array?

## Explanation:
To find the duplicates we can use the array itself as hash table. Iterating over the array we increment the bucket counter by ‘n’, where bucket is array[i].
