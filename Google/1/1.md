# Given a sorted list with pivot find x

### Input:
@Input@
### Output:
@Output@

## Possible Questions to ask:
- Is the pivot always between 0 and N-1, where N is the length of the array.
- Will the element be there in array for sure, if not what should we print.

## Explanation:
We can call the binary search on both sides of the pivot. So it will be like:
binary_search(arr[0], arr[pivot-1], key) and if not found then  binary_search(array[pivot], array[array_size], key)
