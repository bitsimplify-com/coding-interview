# Explanation:
The input file represents a tree like the following.

The format of input is like:
```
First line: number of input, and the root index(typically 0)

root-idx, left-idx, right-idx
1 3 4, means node with idx#1(B) has left child with idx#3(D), and right child with idx#4(E).
2 -1 5, means the node with idx#2 has no left child, and right child with idx#5(F).
```

The idx of a node is its real position in the binary tree e.g.

Node A B C D E F G

idx: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Input :

```
       A             
    /     \          
   B        C            
 /   \       \       
D     E       F     
     /                
    G
```
