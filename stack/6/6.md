# Given a pattern containing only I's and D's. I for increasing and D for decreasing.
# Devise an algorithm to print the minimum number following that pattern.
# Digits from 1-9 and digits can't repeat.
# Constraints:1 ≤ T ≤ 100 ,1 ≤ Length of String ≤ 8
# Example:
# Input :1 D
# Output: 21
### Input:The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.The first line of each test case is a string, which contains only I's and D's in capital letter.
### Output:Print the minimum number following that pattern.
