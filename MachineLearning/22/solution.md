Step 1: Designing the dataset.

We need features in the dataset like watch hours in Netflix, the gender of the subscriber, his/her age, whether he/she has subscribed last month, tenure of their subscription, do they have positive feedback for the platform, do they own a credit card or not.

Step 2: Once designing the dataset is done, we need to plot these features and make sure to eliminate the unwanted features. We will also have to remove the outliers.

Step 3: Then we will have to make a predictive model. Since this is a classification problem, we will use classification models like Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree or SVM. The one among the following which will give the best accuracy or rather the best performance will be finally used in the model.
