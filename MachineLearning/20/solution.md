In simple terms, both of the parameters are equally important. Both if we were to choose between the 2, we would be most likely to go with the model’s performance. This is because of the reason that the model’s accuracy is a subpart of the model’s performance. The accuracy and the performance are directly related, hence the model’s performance outweighs the model’s accuracy. 
 
 The model’s accuracy is not the right parameter because even if you achieve a decent accuracy but say the model is not fast enough and fails for certain kinds of data, then the accuracy is of primarily not use.
