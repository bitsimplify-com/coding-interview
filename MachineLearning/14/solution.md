Boosting is an ensemble modeling technique. It is generally used to increase the accuracy of an algorithm. It builds a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers. It works in a way like it boosts the prediction power of an algorithm by training a sequence of weak models, each better than its predecessor ie each compensates the weakness of its parent.

In alternate words, it works on a series of weak models and helps them increase their proficiency than their parent to ultimately deliver a model which will give the best prediction in the particular scenario.

Boosting is generally of 2 types- ADA Boosting and Gradient Boosting.
