Problems in machine learning involve a lot of use cases of clustering. Clustering means grouping the same type of data in a single group. This means every set of features in a subgroup is similar to others in the same subgroup. Usually, we use Euclidean or Manhattan distance to group these data points. It is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm.
K-Means algorithm is one of the simple known algorithms for clustering of points in a dataset. K means algorithm works in the following way
•	Selecting a value of k, which means into how many clustering are you willing to split your dataset into. Assigning random points for the k selected clusters.
•	We then need to calculate the distance of all the points from the randomly selected centroids. The point is assigned to that cluster which has the lowest distance between the cluster and the data point.
•	Once all the distances have been calculated and points have been marked to their respective clusters, we take the mean of these points and change the randomly generated points for the initial cluster.
We then repeat Steps 1,2 and 3 until and unless we get the same pair of points for the respective clusters ie after 2 consecutive iterations if point a still lies in cluster 2, point b still lies in cluster 1, point c still lies in cluster 2 and point d still lies in cluster 3 (just an example), we say these are respective final cluster.
