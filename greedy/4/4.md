# Check If a String Can Break Another String
# Given two strings: s1 and s2 with the same size, check if some permutation of string s1 can break some permutation of string s2 or vice-versa (in other words s2 can break s1).
# A string x can break string y (both of size n) if x[i] >= y[i] (in alphabetical order) for all i between 0 and n-1.
# Example:
# Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "xya"
# Output: true
# Explanation: "ayx" is a permutation of s2="xya" which can break to string "abc" which is a permutation of s1="abc".
### Input: a single line containing two strings.
### Output: print 1 if one of the strings can break the other,print false otherwise.
