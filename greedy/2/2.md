 # A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

# Example :
# Input: S="ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
# Output: [9,7,8]
### Input: only one line,contains the string to be partitioned
### Output: print a single line with the array values which represents the partitioned arrays lengths in the same order.
